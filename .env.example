# Monarch Money Credentials
#
# Setting these environment variables enables automatic re-authentication
# when your session token expires. Without these, you'll need to run
# login_setup.py manually when the token expires.
#
# SECURITY NOTE:
# - Store credentials securely
# - Add .env to .gitignore (already done)
# - Consider using a password manager or secure environment variable manager
#
# To use:
# 1. Copy this file to .env
# 2. Fill in your credentials
# 3. The MCP server will automatically re-authenticate when needed

MONARCH_EMAIL=your.email@example.com
MONARCH_PASSWORD=your_password_here

# Note: If you have MFA enabled, you'll still need to run login_setup.py
# at least once to complete the initial MFA authentication. After that,
# the session token will be stored in your system keyring and will be
# automatically refreshed using these credentials when it expires.
